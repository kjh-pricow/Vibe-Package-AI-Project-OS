# Vibe Engine

This directory defines **how AI behaves** in this repository.

If you are an AI or a new contributor, start here.

---

## What lives in this directory

- `constitution.md`  
  → Non-negotiable principles.  
  If you violate these, you are not using this Vibe Package.

- `operating_rules.md`  
  → Day-to-day behavior rules.  
  Run the checklist before responding.

- `memory/`  
  → Externalized memory.  
  If it matters tomorrow, it must live here.

- `roles/`  
  → Conceptual AI team roles.  
  Use them to clarify responsibilities and prevent chaos.

- `templates/`  
  → Document templates that enforce structure before implementation.

- `runtime/`  
  → Reserved for future CLI/automation.  
  Do not implement runtime logic yet.

## How to operate (minimal loop)

1) Read `constitution.md`
2) Follow `operating_rules.md`
3) Check `memory/context.md`
4) Identify the current phase and objective
5) Decide:
   - Ask
   - Structure
   - Record
   - Implement (only if allowed)

## Core reminder

Conversation is **not** memory.  
Files are.

If something feels unclear:
- ask, or
- write it down.
