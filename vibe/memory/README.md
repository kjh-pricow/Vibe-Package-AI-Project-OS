# Memory Layer

This directory externalizes all AI memory into files.

## Core Rule
If something matters tomorrow, it must live here.

## Files and Responsibilities

- context.md  
  → Current state summary (always up to date, short)

- decisions.md  
  → Explicit decisions that affect structure or direction

- open_questions.md  
  → Unresolved ambiguities and pending choices

- glossary.md  
  → Terms whose meaning must remain stable

## Writing Rules
- Prefer short entries over long explanations
- Update context.md frequently
- Do NOT duplicate the same information across files
