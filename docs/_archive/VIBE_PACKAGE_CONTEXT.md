# VIBE_PACKAGE_CONTEXT.md
# Source of Truth for Building the Vibe Coding Package

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document exists to fully transfer the context, intent, and design philosophy
behind the Vibe Coding Package into repository-level instructions.

Any AI working in this repository must treat this document as the highest-level
source of truth.

After reading this document, an AI should:
- Not require prior conversation history
- Share the same problem awareness as the user
- Collaborate with the user without missing context

---

## 2. Problem Statement (Why This Package Exists)

### 2.1 Limitations of Traditional Vibe Coding

Common "vibe coding" approaches focus on:
- Rapid, improvised code generation
- Short-term conversational flow

This leads to:
- Loss of context
- Repeated discussions
- Uncontrolled token usage
- No reproducibility
- No team-level sharing
- No CLI or automation compatibility

### 2.2 Limitations of Existing AI Coding Tools

Most existing AI coding tools are:
- IDE-centric
- Single-agent oriented
- Focused on code generation assistance

They lack:
- Project-level thinking
- Decision tracking
- Persistent memory
- Reproducible workflows

**Conclusion:**  
The problem is not AI capability, but the absence of a structure in which AI can work.

## 3. Redefinition of Vibe Coding

Traditional definition:
- Vibe coding = fast code creation

Definition in this project:
- Vibe coding = a process where the user thinks and asks questions in natural language,
  and AI converts that thinking into structure, decisions, and implementations.

Core focus:
- Q&A
- Thought organization
- Explicit decision-making
- Structural clarity

Code is an output, not the center.

---

## 4. Core Concept: AI as a Team

AI is treated as a team with conceptual roles, not a single omniscient tool.

### Conceptual Roles

- User: Owner / PM / Final decision-maker
- Chief AI: Orchestrator and coordinator
- Analyst AI: Converts Q&A into structured specifications
- Dev AI: Translates specs into implementation
- QA AI: Reviews risks and quality
- Librarian AI: Persists all context into files

Key assumption:
- AI does not retain memory reliably
- All memory must be externalized into the file system

---

## 5. What Is a Vibe Package?

A Vibe Package is:
- Not a single conversation
- Not a temporary setup
- A reusable, repository-based project operating system

### Core Principles

1 Vibe Package = 1 Workspace  
1 Vibe Package = 1 Repository

Reasons:
- Prevent context contamination
- Git history becomes decision history
- CLI execution becomes possible
- Environment-independent operation

---

## 6. Repository Structure Concept
repository-root/
├─ vibe/ # AI team, rules, prompts, memory, CLI (engine)
└─ workspace/ # Outputs generated by vibe coding

### vibe/
- Defines how AI behaves
- Contains prompts, policies, memory templates
- Will host CLI/runtime logic

### workspace/
- Stores code, PoCs, and artifacts
- Represents the output of vibe coding

---

## 7. Non-Negotiable Design Rules

1. Source of truth must always live in repository files
2. Chief AI must exist inside the package (not platform settings)
3. ChatGPT Project configuration is a development aid, not runtime logic
4. The system must remain executable via CLI in the future
5. Ambiguity must trigger questions, not assumptions
6. Structure always precedes implementation

---

## 8. What This Project Is (and Is Not)

This project is NOT:
- "Using AI to code faster"
- "A clever prompt setup"
- "A ChatGPT-only workflow"

This project IS:
- A repository-level definition of how AI works
- A system that enables AI to collaborate structurally
- A reproducible, inspectable, and portable AI operating model

---

## 9. Expected AI Behavior After Reading This Document

Any AI working in this repository must:
- Share the user's original problem awareness
- Understand why structure is prioritized over speed
- Avoid jumping directly into implementation
- Continuously ask: "What are we defining right now?"

---

## 10. Current Phase

This repository is currently in the definition phase.

Primary objective:
- Define rules, prompts, policies, and memory structures
- Not implementation
- Not optimization
- Not automation

---

## One-Sentence Summary (For AI)

This repository exists to define a Vibe Coding Package where AI works within
a structured, file-based system that turns human thinking into reproducible projects.
